# Principle #10: Define security and safety requirements for the agent

# Security and Safety Requirements for the Invoice Reconciliation Agent (IRA)

To ensure the secure and safe operation of the Invoice Reconciliation Agent (IRA), the following requirements should be implemented:

## Security Requirements

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: Encrypt all stored data using AES-256 encryption to protect sensitive financial information.
- **In Transit**: Use TLS (Transport Layer Security) to encrypt data transmitted between the IRA and other systems.

### Authentication and Authorization
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for all users accessing the IRA to enhance security.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implement RBAC to ensure that users have access only to the data and functions necessary for their roles.

### Access Control
- **Least Privilege Principle**: Grant users the minimum level of access required to perform their tasks.
- **Audit Logs**: Maintain detailed logs of all access and actions performed by users and the IRA for auditing purposes.

### Data Integrity
- **Checksums and Hashing**: Use checksums and hashing algorithms to verify the integrity of data during transmission and storage.
- **Version Control**: Implement version control for all financial records to track changes and ensure data consistency.

### Incident Response
- **Monitoring and Alerts**: Continuously monitor the IRA for suspicious activities and set up alerts for potential security breaches.
- **Incident Management Plan**: Develop and maintain an incident management plan to respond promptly to security incidents.

### Compliance
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Ensure the IRA complies with relevant financial regulations and standards, such as GDPR, SOX, and PCI-DSS.
- **Regular Audits**: Conduct regular security audits and assessments to identify and mitigate vulnerabilities.

## Safety Requirements

### Data Privacy
- **Anonymization**: Anonymize sensitive data where possible to protect user privacy.
- **Data Minimization**: Collect and process only the data necessary for the IRA's functions.

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: Ensure the IRA can handle errors gracefully without crashing or causing data loss.
- **User Notifications**: Notify users of any errors or issues that require their attention.

### User Training and Awareness
- **Training Programs**: Provide training for users on how to securely and effectively use the IRA.
- **Awareness Campaigns**: Conduct regular awareness campaigns to educate users about security best practices and potential threats.

### Continuous Improvement
- **Feedback Mechanism**: Implement a feedback mechanism for users to report issues and suggest improvements.
- **Regular Updates**: Regularly update the IRA with security patches and enhancements to address new threats and vulnerabilities.

### Human-In-The-Loop (HITL)
- **Manual Review**: Ensure that critical decisions and discrepancies flagged by the IRA are reviewed by human experts.
- **Override Capability**: Provide users with the ability to override automated decisions when necessary, with appropriate logging and justification.

By implementing these security and safety requirements, the Invoice Reconciliation Agent can operate securely and effectively, protecting sensitive financial data and ensuring compliance with relevant regulations.
